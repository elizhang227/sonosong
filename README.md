sonoSong (sono means 'that' in japanese, so our name means 'that song')

Overview

We created a website where users are able to find the complete soundtrack for any movie they want, all conveniently located on one page and clicking on songs will load the youtube video so users do not have to copy and paste the title of the song from some other website into youtube.

The user inputs a movie title that they want the soundtrack for, it returns a list of search results where the user has to choose the desired movie. After they choose the movie there will be a list of all the songs from the soundtrack populated on the page and they have to click on a song they want to listen to and it will embed the corresponding video to the page.

For our project we used 3 APIs: 
    Youtube: where we retrieved the songs from
    Wikipedia: where we retrieved the soundtrack list from
    OMDB: where we retrieved movie information from

Our code and how it works

We had to use API keys for Youtube and OMDB, Wikipedia did not require one.

Step one for our project and I think one of the biggest hurdles in the beginning was understanding and getting the APIs to work and being able to see the json file with all the information. Getting the Youtube API to work was a struggle for me because structuring the correct query parameters was difficult to understand and I couldn't find an example of it.
